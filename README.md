Stock market data analysis of Tata motors project.

1.Developed a predictive model for stock price forecasting for Tata Motors using time series analysis and machine learning algorithms such as SVR, KNN, RF, LSTM, and GRU.

2.Gathered and processed daily stock prices data from 2018 to 2023, including Open, High, Low, and Close prices, from various sources on the web.

3.Evaluated model performance using accuracy, variance, and R-squared score and selected LSTM as the final model for forecasting the stock prices for the next 30 days.

4.Deployed the LSTM model using Python libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Streamlit.
